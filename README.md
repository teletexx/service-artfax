Artfax is a collection of teletext pages. These have been generated by users of Muttlee and can be viewed at http://www.xenoxxx.com/?service=artfax. The pages are mostly collaborations of the Teletext Sofa Club. The file format is tti which is supported by most editors. 

The pages repo is https://github.com/peterkvt80/service-artfax.git. 

In future, this repo will be updated by Muttlee a short while after a change has been made. The algorithm will probably be something like:

The idea is that if the server is getting a lot of modifications, we hold off doing a write back until it gets quiet.

But if it doesn't get quiet then save everything after 30 minutes.

Update the repo if there are changes and it is
* five minutes after the last modification or
* 30 minutes after the first modification

More stuff to add later.
