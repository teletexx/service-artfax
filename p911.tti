OL,6,  We use three digit hex numbers for    
OL,7,  colours. 000 is black and fff is      
OL,8,  white.                                
OL,9,                                        
OL,10,  To convert a web colour to teletext   
OL,11,  take the hex value and remove every   
OL,12,  other nybble. For example, goldenrod  
OL,13,  is _daa520 so the teletext colour     
OL,14,  becomes _da2
