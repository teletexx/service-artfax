OL,6,  We use three digit hex numbers for    
OL,7,  colours. 000 is black and fff is      
OL,8,  white.                                
OL,9,                                        
OL,10,  To convert a web colour to teletext   
OL,11,  take the hex value and remove every   
OL,12,  other nybble. For example, goldenrod  
OL,13,  is _daa520 so the teletext colour     
OL,14,  becomes _da2

OL,4,  Colour lookup table (CLUT)            
OL,6,  Each CLUT contains eight colours.     
OL,7,  There are four CLUTs 0 to 3.          
OL,8,                                        
OL,9,  The CLUTs have these colours:         
OL,10,  CLUT 0 is default colours             
OL,11,  CLUT 1 has darker colours             
OL,12,  CLUT 2 has mixed colours              
OL,13,  CLUT 3 has lighter colours            
OL,14,                                        
OL,15,  The colours of CLUT 0 and CLUT 1 are  
OL,16,  fixed. You can set CLUT 2 and 3       
OL,17,  colours to anything you want.         
OL,18,                                        
OL,19,  Originally teletext pages only used   
OL,20,  the colours in CLUT 0.                
OL,21,                                        
OL,22,  Using packet 28 to remap the CLUTs    
OL,23,  we can access the extra colours.
