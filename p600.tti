OL,4,F To add and remove subpages, press     
OL,5,F Insert and Delete. You can then use   
OL,6,F Page Up and Page Down to flick        
OL,7,F between the subpages                  
OL,8,````````````````````````````````````````
OL,9,  If you want to see the pages cycle    
OL,10,  you can press ESC until the page      
OL,11,  number returns to white. The carousel 
OL,12,  speed is eight seconds by default.    
OL,13,  If you want to change it then you     
OL,14,  need to edit the repo. PeterK or any  
OL,15,  admin can do that for you. User       
OL,16,  editable timings are on my TODO list. 
OL,17,````````````````````````````````````````
OL,18,F Carousels can not be exported to any  
OL,19,F other teletext editor except wxTED.   
OL,20,F For use with vbit2, export these as   
OL,21,F tti or grab them direct from the repo.
